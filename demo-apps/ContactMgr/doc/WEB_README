The ContactMgr app can be used to demonstrate the early web capabilities 
of JMatter.

Note:  the current implementation of JMatter's web view mechanism is 
alpha-quality.

Foundation

The web work is based on the excellent WingS web application framework 
(see http://www.j-wings.org/).  The unique aspect of WingS is that its API 
tries to be analogous to the Swing API.  I chose this framework so as to 
maintain the existing JMatter design.  Producing a web view mechanism ends
up being a fairly straightforward porting job.

The next version of WingS is expected to support AJAX features (requests 
will not reload entire page) and (I hope/exect) InternalFrames will actually 
be draggable.  These improvements should come about with little to no change 
to the WingS API.


Basic Steps to Run JMatter App Either as a Web App
---

(It is worth noting that this application will still run as a Swing
 application the same old way, either deployed as a Java WebStart 
 application, or run from the command line, say with "ant run")


1. Invoke the ant task:

  ant web-app

  This will produce the web application in the subdirectory "build/web"

  Move that direcory to your web server's webapps directory (tested
  with jetty):

    mv build/web $WEBHOME/webapps/ContactMgr

2. Start the web server.  Example for jetty:

  cd jetty
  ./bin/jetty.sh start

3. Fire up firefox and hit http://localhost:8080/ContactMgr


What's not yet implemented
-----------

 - UI support for Associations (big one)
 - UI support for query features
 - UI support for wizards
 - Alternative views (tableview, omniview, etc..)
 - Polish (make it look good)
 - Drag and Drop support
