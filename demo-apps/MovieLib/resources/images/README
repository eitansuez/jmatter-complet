For each model class you define, place here two corresponding
icons representing that type.  The image file format can be
either gif, jpg, or png.

File naming convention is as the following example illustrates:

  e.g.:  class:  Person

   image file:  Person16.gif
                Person32.gif

Again, the file format can be something other than gif (jpg or png).

Small and large image file names are the class name concatenated 
with '16' and '32' respectively.  These images should be 16x16
and 32x32 pixels in size.
