Technical Notes:

a. JMatter AppBrowser
   (see documentation for more information on the AppBrowser (chapter: deployment, take 2))

   With versions of hibernate prior to 3.3, that by default used CGLIB for class enhancement,
   it was necessary to patch hibernate CGLIBLazyInitializer class to use the correct class
   loader in order to properly resolve remotely classloaded application classes.

   class:  org.hibernate.proxy.pojo.cglib.CGLIBLazyInitializer
   method:  public static Class getProxyFactory(Class persistentClass, Class[] interfaces)
   after line:  140
   description:  need to make sure the Enhancer uses the right class loader
   instructions:  add line:
      e.setClassLoader(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader());

   With hibernate v3.3, the default class enhancer is now Javassist.  And patching is no
   longer necessary.

   JMatter is using hibernate v3.3.1 as of release xxx.
