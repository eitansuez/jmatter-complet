Technical Notes:

a. To make hibernate work with the JMatter AppBrowser (see documentation for more
   information on the AppBrowser (chapter: deployment, take 2)), hibernate needs to be
   patched as follows:

   class:  org.hibernate.proxy.pojo.cglib.CGLIBLazyInitializer
   method:  public static Class getProxyFactory(Class persistentClass, Class[] interfaces)
   after line:  140
   description:  need to make sure the Enhancer uses the right class loader
   instructions:  add line:
      e.setClassLoader(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader());

   Every release of JMatter strives to use the latest stable version of Hibernate
   (upcoming:  v3.3.1), with the above patch installed.
   (currently waiting for hibernate site to come back online so can review
    how to build hibernate3.jar with mvn)
