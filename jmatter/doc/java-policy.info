Reminder on how to configure java security on machines
to allow locally deployed apps without signing:


  1. create $java.home/lib/security/additional.policy as:
    // should be (but doesn't work):  grant codeBase "http://apple-g5:8080/-"
    grant codeBase "file:///-"
    {
      permission java.security.AllPermission;
    };

  2. in $java.home/lib/security/java.security, add this line:
    policy.url.3=file:${java.home}/lib/security/additional.policy

Note:  this is a bad idea because codeBase doesn't really work.  It's a 
  security hole.  Information placed here only for the purpose of 
  remembering how this is configured.
