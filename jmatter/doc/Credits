Eitan Suez is the principal author of JMatter.  I would like
to extend my thanks to the following individuals for their
contributions to JMatter, though this list is not exhaustive.

 - Guizhong Chen
 - Mike Horn

 - The animating card layout library and its authors!
   Their animations are leveraged in JMatter.

 - Jim Slack

      Jan 2008:  Jim contributes the program "ReverseEngineer"
      which reverse engineers an existing database schema 
      to generate its corresponding JMatter source code.
 
 - Andres Almiray
 
      Andres has been evangelizing JMatter since our meeting
      at the Desktop Matters conference in the Spring of 2007.
      He's developed a groovy builder for JMatter wizards that
      illustrates the value of combining JMatter with groovy.
      Andres has also shown how to integrate JMatter with
      SwingX mapping-enabled components, which is now partly
      integrated into JMatter.

 - David McPaul and Justin
 
      David and Justin were some of the earliest adopters of
      JMatter and employ the technology in-house at their
      company down under.
      
 - Marco Meschieri

      Marco meticulously extracted captions and bits of text from
      the JMatter codebase and concentrated them in resource bundles
      to fully localize the UI.  Thank you Marco.

 - Ryan Ramage

      Ryan is the author of UltraViolet, a JMatter UML
      design tool.  He also wrote UMLC, a JMatter uml
      compiler.  See:

 - Felix Torre

      Felix and myself co-developed localization in JMatter:
      the ability to work with JMatter in languages other
      than English.
