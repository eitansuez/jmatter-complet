JMatter IntelliJ IDEA Templates
-------------------------------

This tool thus far consists of one basic file template and a number
of live templates that can significantly assist the development of
JMatter applications within IDEA.

Installation
------------

  1. Locate the base directory of your IntelliJ IDEA preferences directory.
     On my disk it's ~/.IntelliJIdea60

  2. Copy the file ACO.java to config/fileTemplates

  3. Copy the file jmatter.xml to config/templates


In IDEA
-------

After creating a Java project, you can create basic JMatter model
objects in a manner similar to the creation of new classes:

  Select a package in the side bar
  Righ-click "New->ACO"
  Specify the class name

In the IDEA project settings, enter the "Live Templates" section.
You can inspect the various live templates defined for jmatter
under the "jmatter" tree node.

Some examples include:

       fo      -> expands to the metadata specification for fieldOrder
       flat    -> expands to the 'flattenIntoParent' metadata specification
       bprop   -> will write the bound property getter and setter methods for you
       tv      -> tabViews..
       plu     -> will write the pluralName() method to override the pluralname for a type


Sincerely,
  Eitan Suez
  JMatter
